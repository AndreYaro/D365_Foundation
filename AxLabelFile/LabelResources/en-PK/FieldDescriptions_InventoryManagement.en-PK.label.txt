InventModelGroup_CostPrice_InclPhysicalValueInCost=Select this option to indicate that transactions that are physically updated should be included in the calculation of the average cost. At inventory close, this parameter may be used, depending on the method that is used for inventory valuation.

When this option is selected, receipts and issues are posted as follows: for purchase receipts, posting occurs at the actual cost; for purchase invoices, the price difference between the actual cost and the fixed receipt price is posted to the general ledger as a variance; the amount is posted to the loss or profit account for the fixed receipt price. Inventory is updated based on the fixed receipt price; and for sales order packing slips and sales invoices, posting occurs at the estimated cost. When you run an inventory close or a recalculation, if this option is selected, the value of issue transactions is adjusted according to the price that is specified in the Price field. If this option is cleared, the value of issue transactions is not adjusted according to this price. If the fixed receipt price is changed, and you want all new issue transactions to use the new cost, follow these steps: run an inventory close, adjust the balance for the on-hand inventory, so that the balance matches the new cost, and then activate a new planned cost.

The date comes at the start of the number and uses the YYMMDD format. For example, locating inventory receipts to cover a sales order is performed in dimension order. For items that are associated with a tracking dimension group where the batch number dimension is active, orders are processed by batch number. A problem occurs when a purchase order is created for a receipt on May 20 and in batch number 345. A new purchase order is created for a receipt on May 10 and in batch number 346. If a sales order is received for delivery on May 15, the problem occurs when the purchase order is automatically picked for May 20, which is the lowest batch number, and the sales order is delayed. However, when the delivery date is included in the batch number that is automatically generated, the batch numbers are 000520-345 and 000510-346. The auto-reservation then picks the purchase order for May 10.

InventParameters_Check_BOMMaxLevel=Enter the maximum number of item levels that a BOM can have
 ;Description text for the Check_BOMMaxLevel control on the InventParameters form
InventParameters_Check_CheckBOMWhen=Select when to check for circular structures in BOMs. A circular BOM reflects an item that has been defined as a component of itself. This is regardless of whether it is a first-level component or a lower-level component. A circular BOM is not supported. If a circular BOM exists, cost rollup calculations and planning calculations identify the error, and the calculations are not completed. If you select Line, this prevents a BOM line from being added when the component item would cause BOM circularity. The line check policy provides immediate feedback about a BOM circularity error. We recommended that you use this policy for checking BOM circularity. If you select Never, this means that BOM lines that would cause BOM circularity are not prevented. You can use the Check function in the BOM line page to identify a BOM circularity error, and the error is also identified when you perform cost rollup calculations and planning calculations. If you select BOM, a BOM circularity check is performed when you close the Bills of materials page, use the Check function in the Bills of materials page, and when you associate a BOM with a BOM version. Caution: The controls preventing a circular BOM do not apply to a production BOM for a production order. You can manually add a component or consume a component that would ultimately create BOM circularity. When the component consumption reflects BOM circularity, the inventory closing process might not calculate a sensible cost for a manufactured item that has an actual costing inventory valuation method. In such an occurrence, the use of a manufacturing indirect cost of the surcharge type can also cause problems in inventory closing, because the calculated cost can grow exponentially.
