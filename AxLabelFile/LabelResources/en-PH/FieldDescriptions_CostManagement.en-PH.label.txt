BOMCalcDialog_BOMCalcCostingVersionUpdate=Select whether the BOM calculations should overwrite the existing pending cost record for an item or only update it when a pending cost record does not exist for the specified costing version, site, and effective date. This is termed a missing cost. A missing cost can indicate a new manufactured item or an item that requires recalculation. An item's pending cost record can be deleted so that it is treated as a missing cost. When trying to update costs for selected items with missing costs, it may be useful to be notified that a selected item already has a pending cost record. This prevents the outcome of updating the missing costs. Use the BOM calculation warning policy (for identifying missing updates) to identify when an item's pending cost record already exists so that a warning message will be displayed in the Infolog that is generated by the BOM calculation.

PlanActivityDetails_Quantity_ProcessQuantity=Enter the minimum quantity to use to calculate the actual time that a job will require, or the labor cost for a job when calculating standard cost. If this value is higher than the actual job quantity, or the actual job quantity is not a multiple of this value, then the cost and times are rounded up to the next multiple of this value. If you do not want to round up, then the value should be the lowest allowed by the unit of measure. For quantities without decimal points, this is 1. For quantities with two decimal points, this is .01. For example, If an activity uses one hour of runtime to produce 10 with an activity quantity of 10, and the unit of measure is each, then a job for 15 each will be calculated to require two hours. If an activity uses one hour of runtime to produce 1 with an activity quantity of 1, and the job quantity is 1.5, then a job will require two hours. If an activity uses one hour of runtime to produce 1 with an activity quantity of 0.01, and the job quantity is 1.5, then a job will require 1.5 hours.

The ratio is used to calculate the average cycle times for all activities of the production flow. The ratio is also used to calculate the Required takt time time of a feeder activity that is related to a downstream (successor) activity of a different production flow. You can include a scrap factor in the ratio. Example A cycle time ratio with the value 1 means that the activity cycle time is equal to the Average takt time time of the production flow version. This is the default value. A cycle time ratio with the value 2 means that the activity has to feed two activities per cycle time. Item A is produced in work cell A. Item A consumes two units of item B which is produced in the upstream work cell B. The cycle time ratio is 2.

ReqItemTable_ctrlCovFields_CovPeriod=Enter a time period, as a number of days, during which master scheduling consolidates all requirements for the item and generates one planned order to cover the sum of these demands. If you enter 5, for example, planned orders are consolidated for five-day periods. The coverage period starts on the date of the first requirement, and the planned order is generated on this date. The requirement date, such as the delivery date, determines which period the planned order is put in. This field is available when you select Period in the Coverage code list. For example, the coverage period is 5 and the minimum quantity is 0. There are sales orders that have requirement dates of September 1, September 3, September 10, September 14, and September 20. Master scheduling generates three planned orders. One planned order is dated September 1. This planned order covers September 1 to September 3. One planned order is dated September 10. This planned order covers September 10 to September 14. One planned order is dated September 20. This planned order covers September 20.
 ;Description text for the ctrlCovFields_CovPeriod control on the ReqItemTable form
ReqItemTable_ctrlCovFields_CovRule=Select the method that master scheduling uses to calculate requirements for the item. The following options are available: \r\n\r\nPeriod (when demand brings the projected inventory for the period below the specified minimum quantity, a planned order is generated to fulfill all demands that occur in the period that is specified in the Coverage period field; the period starts on the date of the first requirement, and the planned order is generated on this date), \r\n\r\nRequirement (a planned order is generated to fulfill every requirement that brings inventory below the minimum quantity), \r\n\r\nMin./Max. (when demand brings the projected inventory below the specified minimum quantity, a planned order is generated to bring inventory up to the specified maximum quantity; when you use this method, items that are physically reserved are not included when requirements are calculated), \r\n\r\nManual (master scheduling does not calculate requirements or generate planned orders for the item; the item is assumed to be manually planned; this method is best used for items that are easy to buy, and for items that are managed by visual inspection), \r\n\r\nPriority (Balance supply for demand with a demand driven approach, including Planning priority and use the values in Minimum, Reorder point and Maximum; Priority is only available with Planning Optimization enabled).

ReqItemTable_ctrlCovFields_MaxNegativeDays=Enter a number of days that are added to a requirement due date to define a time interval during which a planned receipt that is due can be used to fulfill the requirement. A planned receipt that is due outside the defined time interval cannot be used to fulfill the requirement, and master scheduling generates a new planned order. You can equate negative days with the number of days that a delivery can be past due before you create a new fulfillment order. During this period, there is a negative inventory level for the item. You can specify negative days in the Item coverage page or the Coverage groups page. The full behavior of negative days depends on whether you select the Use dynamic negative days option in the Master planning parameters page. For example, for an item, a purchase order is scheduled for receipt on the twentieth of the month, and a sales order is scheduled for delivery on the nineteenth of the same month. Master scheduling either generates a new planned purchase order to cover the requirement, or it creates a late sales order delivery on the twentieth. If you set the negative days to 0 (zero), a new planned purchase order is generated. If you set the negative days to a number greater than zero, no planned purchase order is generated. Instead, an action message is generated for the purchase order, and a futures message is generated for the sales order.
 ;Description text for the ctrlCovFields_MaxNegativeDays control on the ReqItemTable form
ReqItemTable_ctrlCovFields_MaxPositiveDays=Enter the interval, as a number of days that are subtracted from a requirement due date to define a time interval during which a planned receipt that is due can be used to fulfill the requirement. A planned receipt that is due outside the defined time interval is not valid to fulfill the requirement, and master scheduling generates a new planned order. You can equate positive days with the number of days that you use existing inventory before you create a new fulfillment order. During this period, there is a positive inventory level for the item. You can specify positive days in the Item coverage page or the Coverage groups page. For example, for a particular item, inventory exists, and a sales order is scheduled for delivery in 90 days. Master scheduling either generates a new planned purchase order to cover the requirement, or it fulfills the order from the current inventory. If you set the positive days to a number that is less than 90, a new planned purchase order is generated. If you set the positive days to a number that is greater than 90, no planned purchase order is generated. However, current inventory levels of the item are no longer available for new sales orders. If you use automatic reservation when you create sales orders, or if you use manual reservation later, values in the Positive days field are not considered in master scheduling.

If the base calendar is used, it is updated according to the base calendar that you select. Normal working times are created for the operation resources in the company's production system. Other working times, such as shifts and weekend work, can be created in the form of different times per day. You should create known variances, such as holidays, as separate working hours. You can then record variance for the operation resources that are associated with the working time when the variance occurs. An efficiency percentage can be associated with each working time.
 ;Description text for the WorkCalendarDate_WorkTimeControl control on the WorkCalendarDate form
WorkCalendarDate_WorkCalendarDateLine_Effectivity=Define the efficiency percentage that is used when production is scheduled during the interval. Scheduling time = Time * 100 / Efficiency percentage. The time that is used in the formula includes both processing time and setup time. For example, if the efficiency percentage is 200, all scheduling times are reduced by 50 percent. You can define the efficiency percentage for both the operation time and the operation resource. The capacity is then calculated based on the efficiency percentage of both the operation resource and the working time. For example, you can use the efficiency percentage of operation times when shifts have different efficiencies.

WrkCtrTable_Route_ErrorPct=The expected extra consumption for the operation. The extra consumption is included in the calculation of both material and operations resource consumption for the current operation. The value must be positive. The error percentage is summarized in the Accumulated field for the current route. Accumulated error is used in the calculation of extra consumption of materials and resource time for the individual operations in the route. The formula for the calculation is as follows: Accumulated for the next operation number * 100 / (100 - Scrap percentage). The field value is transferred to the route operation when you select the resource. For example, in the production of 100 pieces, for all three operations 10, 20, and 30, 10 percent is scrapped. To finish 100 pieces, 111 pieces must go to operation 30 from operation 20. 100 pieces * 100 / (100 – 10). To finish 111 pieces in operation 20, 123 pieces must come from operation 10. (111 pieces * 100 / (100 – 10)). Similarly, operation 10 must be started with 137 pieces in order to reach the ultimate production quantity of 100 pieces.

WrkCtrTable_Scheduling_CapLimited=Select this option to indicate that the capacity is limited. If this option is cleared, the capacity is unlimited. By using finite capacity, the scheduling of operations or jobs is based on the actual available capacity in the resource group or resource. The amount of capacity that is already reserved on the resource is not considered.
 ;Description text for the Scheduling_CapLimited control on the WrkCtrTable form
WrkCtrTable_Scheduling_EffectivityPct=The percentage of the calendar opening time that the system schedules on a specific resource per day. You can reduce or increase the processing time of individual jobs per day by using the efficiency percentage. For example, if a job setup requires six hours, and the efficiency percentage for the resource is 50 percent, the job will reserve the capacity for three hours on the first day and three hours on the second day.
 ;Description text for the Scheduling_EffectivityPct control on the WrkCtrTable form
WrkCtrTable_Scheduling_Exclusive=When you use primary and secondary operations, select this option to reserve the resource exclusively for a job. Ongoing jobs for the resource will not be interrupted by other jobs. For example, a primary resource is exclusive. When there is a break in the scheduling of the secondary resource, the primary resource cannot be reserved for other jobs. As another example, a secondary resource is exclusive. Performing an operation requires a 50-percent load on the secondary resource. The secondary resource is reserved at 100-percent load, even though it is operating at 50 percent, and no other jobs can be scheduled on that resource until the job is completed. If this option is cleared, when there is a gap between reservations or a resource is not being used at 100-percent capacity, it can be reserved for other jobs.
 ;Description text for the Scheduling_Exclusive control on the WrkCtrTable form

The value of this field is transferred to the Setup time field on the route operation when you select the resource as a costing resource.
 ;Description text for the Times_SetupTime control on the WrkCtrTable form
WrkCtrTable_Times_ToHours=The conversion factor for the times specified for the operation, for conversion to hours with two decimals. The following formula is used: Hours = operating time * Hours/time. For example, if the operation time is in hours: Hours/time is 1.0000. For an operation time of 0.50 (a half hour), the time is calculated as follows: 0.50 * 1.0000 = 0.50 hours. If the operation time is in minutes: Hours/time is set to 0.0167.
