AsyncOrderCancellationFeatureLabel=Enable asynchronous order cancelation
;Label for async order cancellation feature.
AsyncOrderCancellationFeatureSummary=This feature allows the store associates to asynchronously cancel the asynchronous customer orders so that the store associates can return the customer deposit, if any and submit the cancelation request. However, the orders get canceled when the cancelation request in processed in the headquarters. Moreover, this feature enables the system administrator to add the "Force conclude operation" to the transaction grid so that the store associate can complete the order asynchronously, if the order capture is taking a long time to complete.
