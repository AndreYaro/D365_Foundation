TaxWithholdThresholdBasedOnPaymentFeature=(India) Enable TCS calculation on payment collection from customer basis
 ;{Locked=!en-IN} Feature description
TaxWithholdThresholdBasedOnPaymentFeatureSummary=Enablement of this feature will activate the option for the user to apply TCS based on the payment amount received from customer during the defined date range. This option will be available through the advance threshold feature only. The threshold defined for the tax code will be compared against the accumulated value of payment received. Once the accumulated received amount exceeds the threshold value, TCS can be applied to sales Invoice or payment, or both. On posting Sales Invoice TCS will post to interim account and on Invoice settlement with payment voucher TCS will transfer to payable amount directly.
