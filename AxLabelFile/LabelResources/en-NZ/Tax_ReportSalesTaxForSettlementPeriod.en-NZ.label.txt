PrintReportHelpText=The parameter controls the printing of the GST payment report after the Settle and post GST procedure is finished. When the parameter is set to No, after the settlement process is completed, no GST payment report is printed. Instead, you receive the following message: "The GST settlement and posting is completed. The voucher 'xxxx, m/d/yyyy' has been posted."\r\nThe report might not print automatically, even if the parameter is set to Yes. You can print the report from the 'GST payments' page after 'Settle and post GST' is executed, or if 'Settle and post GST' is run in a batch, you can print the report from the 'GST payments' page once the job is completed.
