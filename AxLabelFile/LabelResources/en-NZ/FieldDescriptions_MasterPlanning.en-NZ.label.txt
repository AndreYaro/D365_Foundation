Requirements that are derived from the specified BOM version are used, regardless of the current inventory available.
 ;Description text for the Diverse_BOMVersionReq control on the ReqGroup form
ReqGroup_ItemCov_MaxNegativeDays=Enter the days that are added to a requirement due date. This number defines a time interval during which a planned receipt that is due can be used to fulfil the requirement. A planned receipt that is outside the defined time interval cannot be used to fulfil the requirement. Master scheduling generates a new planned order. You can equate negative days with the number of delivery days that are past due. During this time, there is a negative inventory level for the item. You must accept the negative inventory level before you can create a new fulfilment order. The value that you enter depends on factors such as item lead time and the Organisation's policy about inventory. If an item has a long lead time, you can specify the typical lead time as negative days. You can specify negative days in either the Item coverage page or the Coverage groups page. The full behaviour of negative days depends on whether you select the Use dynamic negative days option in the Master planning parameters page. For example, for a particular item, a purchase order is scheduled for receipt on September 20, and a sales order is scheduled for delivery on September 19. You must specify whether to generate a new planned purchase order to cover the requirement, or to accept a late delivery for the sales order on September 20. If you set the negative days to 0 (zero), a new planned purchase order is generated. If you set the negative days to a number that is larger than zero, no planned purchase order is generated. Instead, an action message is generated for the purchase order, and a futures message is generated for the sales order.
 ;Description text for the ItemCov_MaxNegativeDays control on the ReqGroup form or on the Master plans page.
ReqGroup_ItemCov_MaxPositiveDays=Enter the number of days that are subtracted from a requirement due date. This number defines a time interval during which a planned receipt that is due can be used to fulfil the requirement. A planned receipt that is outside the defined time interval cannot be used to fulfil the requirement. Master scheduling generates a new planned order. You can equate positive days with the number of days that you can use existing inventory before you must create a new fulfilment order. For items that you regularly order and procure, specify the item's coverage period as positive days. For items that have few transactions, specify the coverage group's coverage period as positive days.You can specify positive days in either the Item coverage page or the Coverage groups page. For example, for a particular item, there is inventory, and a sales order is scheduled for delivery in 90 days. If you enter a number that is less than 90, a new planned purchase order is generated. If you set the positive days to a number that is more than 90, no planned purchase order is generated. However, the current inventory levels of the item are no longer available for new sales orders.

By using dynamic positive days, you can include the item lead time in the calculation. This provides increased accuracy: if the on-hand or scheduled receipt is within the item lead time, it will be used. If the on-hand or scheduled receipt is outside of the item lead time, a new planned order will be created, leaving the existing on-hand or scheduled receipts unused. This helps companies with last minute orders or make to order, where it is needed to make the best use of the on-hand and receipts.

ReqParameters_ReqInactive=Master planning takes a snapshot of the item’s net requirements before planning. The last step in the planning process is to take into consideration any changes that may have occurred in the net requirements since the snapshot was taken. All changes to the item’s net requirements, such as a sales order line quantity increase or transfer order line quantity decrease, are logged in a table called InventSumLogTTS. This table is used to maintain the state of the dynamic plan, by keeping track of all changes in demand and supply that occurred since the last master planning regeneration. This table is only cleaned up by a master planning regeneration. If it is never cleaned, the table keeps growing and clogs system performance. If you do not intend to run master planning or any other planning processes (explosion, production order scheduling with finite material, CTP delivery date control) in a specific company, set the Master planning > Setup > Master planning parameters > Disable all planning processes parameter to Yes. This will prevent records from being logged in the InventSumLogTTS table.  When a new company is created, this parameter is by default set to Yes. This means that if you intend to implement planning processes in a company, you need to manually set Master planning > Setup > Master planning parameters > Disable all planning processes parameter to No.

ReqPlanSched_CoverageProduction_BottleneckScheduling=Select this option to calculate master scheduling by using finite capacity for those resources that are defined as bottleneck resources. You can use bottleneck scheduling to extend the finite capacity time fence for a limited number of resources. Bottleneck resources can be scheduled by using finite capacity for a longer period of time than non-bottleneck resources. This field is available only when you select the Finite capacity option.
 ;Description text for the CoverageProduction_BottleneckScheduling control on the ReqPlanSched form
ReqPlanSched_CoverageProduction_CovCapLimited=Select this option to indicate that the scheduling of planned production orders will consider capacity that has already been reserved. Note that planned production orders are backward-scheduled from the requirement date. If capacity is not available, the requirement for component items is sought on an earlier date than what the optimal production sequence can carry out. If the capacity can be changed as the requirement changes, such as when working with shifts, you should not select this option because calculated processing times will be incorrect. Scheduling considers capacity that is already reserved only if you selected the Finite capacity option in the Resources page. Selecting this option makes the Finite capacity time fence field available to modify.

This field is available only when you select the Finite capacity option. To include a resource in finite capacity scheduling, you must select the Finite capacity field in the individual resource or resource group. Example 1: You enter 15 in this field and set the capacity time fence to 100  Master scheduling uses finite capacity for the first 15 days and infinite capacity for the remaining days of the time fence. Example 2: You enter 25 in this field, and the item belongs to a coverage group that states a capacity time fence of 10  Master scheduling uses finite capacity for 10 days. Example 3: You enter 0 (zero) in this field  Master scheduling does not use finite capacity.
 ;Description text for the CoverageProduction_TimeFenceFiniteCap control on the ReqPlanSched form
ReqPlanSched_ForecastPlan_ForecastReduceType=Select a method to use to reduce forecast requirements during master scheduling. If you choose None: Forecast requirements are not reduced during master scheduling.

ReqPlanSched_MaxPositiveDays=Enter the number of days that are subtracted from a requirement due date. This number defined a time interval during which a planned receipt that is due can be used to fulfil the requirement. A planned receipt that is outside the defined time interval cannot be used to fulfil the requirement. Master scheduling generates a new planned order. You can equate positive days with the number of days that you can use existing inventory before you must create a new fulfilment order. For items that you regularly order and produce, specify the coverage group's coverage period as positive days. You can specify positive days in either the Item coverage page or the Coverage groups page. For example, for a particular item, there is inventory, and a sales order is scheduled for delivery in 90 days. If you enter a number that is less than 90, no planned purchase order is generated. However, the current inventory levels of the item are no longer available for new sales orders.
