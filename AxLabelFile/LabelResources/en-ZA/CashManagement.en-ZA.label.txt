BankCurrencyRevalResetOverviewP2=This process resets the bank foreign currency revaluation process by generating an accounting entry to reverse the total unrealised gain or loss for selected bank accounts. This is necessary for the following scenarios:\r\n\r\n•  Organisations that want to change from using all financial dimensions to utilising no financial dimensions, or vice versa, during the bank revaluation. The financial dimension usage of All or None must be defined within this wizard and not at the time of revaluation. A consistent set of financial dimensions (All or None) must be used for future revaluations because the gain or loss is calculated as a delta from the prior revaluations.\r\n\r\n•  Organisations that have large amounts distributed to different dimension values due to cash being debited to one dimension value but credited to a different dimension value. The process will reverse the large amounts, allowing new revaluations to calculate the amounts at the selected financial dimension level of All or None and eliminating the posting of large amounts.
