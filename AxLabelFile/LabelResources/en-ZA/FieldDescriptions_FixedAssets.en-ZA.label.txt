The acquisition price is updated every time that an acquisition or an acquisition adjustment is posted for the fixed asset and book combination.
 ;Description text for the Acquisition_AcquisitionPrice control on the AssetBook form
AssetBook_AssetBook_BookId=Select the book to assign to the selected fixed asset. By default, books for the fixed asset are assigned automatically based on the setup of the fixed asset group, but you can add other books. You can also delete books from the setup of the fixed asset if no transactions have been posted for the book. If separate VAT transactions must be posted, a book for VAT purposes must also be assigned to each fixed asset. Additional books can be added for other accounting purposes, such as concern values of the fixed assets or for calculation purposes.

AssetBook_AssetBook_CurrentLifeTime_JP=The number of depreciation periods for the fixed asset. When depreciation periods are part of the setup of the depreciation calculation, they are used to calculate straight line depreciation and factor depreciation. The default service life in years for the book can be set up for the fixed asset group, but can be changed for each fixed asset and book combination. The depreciation periods are calculated by using the setting in the Period frequency field in the Depreciation profiles page. If the period frequency is Quarterly, the service life of 1 is equal to four quarters in the Depreciation periods field. If the period frequency is Yearly, the service life of 4 is equal to four periods.

 ;Description text for the AssetBook_CurrentServiceLife_JP control on the AssetBook form
AssetBook_AssetBook_DepreciationStartDate=The starting date for the first depreciation calculation, which is based on the placed-in-service date and depreciation convention. Because some countries/regions might require that you set up the date for the first depreciation differently, sometimes even months before the acquisition, you can change the date. The date that you enter remains the same when acquisition transactions are posted, even when the date differs from the depreciation run date. You should verify this date for all new fixed assets before the first depreciation. No depreciation can be posted before a fixed asset is acquired. Therefore, if the placed-in-service date is before the date of acquisition, the first depreciation that is calculated after the acquisition will include the depreciation that was calculated between the placed-in-service date and the acquisition date. For example, a fixed asset is acquired on December 31, 2011, and the depreciation profile is straight line quarterly. Depreciation starts on July 1, 2009 (depreciation run date), the acquisition price is 10.000, and the service life is 4 (quarters). The depreciation that is calculated on December 31, 2011, is 5.000 (for two quarters).

The depreciation periods are calculated by using the setting in the Period frequency field in the Depreciation profiles page.

Books that have statuses of Suspended, Closed, Sold, or Scrapped cannot be updated with additional fixed asset transactions. However, you can manually change the status at any time and reopen the fixed asset for any kind of transaction. You must update the fixed asset status for each book that is assigned to the fixed asset. For example, an asset might be fully depreciated for VAT purposes and closed for its VAT book, but can be open for accounting purposes because more depreciation will be posted in the future. The status of a fixed asset is usually updated automatically. However, you can modify the status of the fixed asset.
