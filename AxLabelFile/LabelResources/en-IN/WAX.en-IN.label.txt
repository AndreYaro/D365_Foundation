Example 2, picking two LP of 25 boxes to satisfy a single work line of 50 boxes would require you to capture weight twice, once for each LP being picked. This policy option is also used when registering material consumption for batch orders.

The feature is depending on having the “Catch weight for warehouse” configuration key enabled.\r\nIn case upgrading from a version having the capability running in preview the feature will automatically become enabled.\r\nThe following inventory status change functionality will be enabled:\r\n• Inventory status change (periodic).\r\n• Quality order validation (inventory status change).\r\n• Inventory status change from on-hand by location form.\r\n• Inventory status change via warehousing app movement work.\r\nTo ensure correct results when enabling this feature, review and, if necessary, update existing queries that update inventory status. The inventory status change processes that currently use queries might perform differently after this feature is enabled because catch weight products are being included, whereas catch weight products were previously skipped.

WHSCatchWeightFeature_Summary=This functionality will provide support for using catch weight products within warehouse management processes. Catch weight products are often used in industries where products vary by weight and/or size, such as the food industry. Catch weight products use two units of measurement - an inventory unit (such as kg, lb, or oz) and a catch weight unit (such as box, each, or pallet). The inventory unit is the unit of measurement in which the product is weighed and invoiced. The catch weight unit is the unit in which the products are handled, such as received, transferred, and shipped. The feature "Inventory status changes for catch weight products" can as well be enabled when using different inventory statuses.

WHSClusterPositionFullFeature_Label=Cluster position full
 ;Label for WHSClusterPositionFullFeature
WHSClusterPositionFullFeature_Summary=This feature offers an alternative to more rigid enforcement of work break rules when using cluster picking as it enables larger margin of error in volumetric constraints of containers or totes. It is a common scenario that not all items within the work order fit into a selected container. This leaves the warehouse worker who is cluster picking with little option for resolution, either changing the container size to a larger one or solving it differently with the supervisor.\nThis functionality introduces the ability to execute ‘full’ option on one of the work units within a cluster. This was not an option with cluster picking in older version, but it was only available with normal order picking. However, this feature differs from standard full button flow as it cancels the remaining work. It does not suggest user to add another bin to same cluster and it does not create new work automatically.

WHSConfirmAndTransferFeature_Label=Confirm and transfer
 ;Label for WHSConfirmAndTransferFeature
WHSConfirmAndTransferFeature_Summary=The confirm and transfer features allows users to ship loads out of the warehouse prior to all work associated with the load being completed. When ship confirming, if all of the load lines are not fully picked, then the user will be prompted to either split off the remaining quantities onto a new load or cancel the quantities that have not been completed. \n the setup to allow splitting of loads you can handle scenarios where already planned and partially loaded Loads need to be adapted due to new or changing circumstances.\nNew logic has been added to the client to allow a Load that is partially loaded to be closed and ship confirmed. If necessary, and if allowed by the setup, all remaining shipments and load lines, this includes full or partial line quantities, will be rolled over to newly created load and shipment. New shipment and load are automatically created based on initial Shipment/Load creation criteria and will keep the main attributes unchanged. Further, there is also an option to auto cancel the remaining quantities if work order has not been created yet and if deemed necessary by the user.\nThis functionality supports the scenario in which all product cannot fit onto a truck or where some of the load should leave the warehouse before the remainder is ready for shipping. The left-over product can therefore be transferred to a new load and consequently to a new truck. This feature can be used with loads that are otherwise intended to allow only full load shipping and therefore gives more flexibility to transport managers for solving nonstandard or unforeseen scenarios.\nPlease note that this functionality is not the same as transport load feature as transport load feature should be used in warehouses that never are able to plan and create load prior to picking but do loading of the available transportation space after picking is completed.\nConfirm and transfer feature is used where loads are planned and created but where sometimes exceptions occur where load does not fit the available transport e.g. truck.

WHSLocationDirectiveInventoryPickingAgingStrategiesFeature_Summary=Note: In order for this feature to work, please do  first enable “Warehouse location status” feature.\nLocation directive strategies are introduced to be used in picking: FIFO (First In First Out) and LIFO (Last In First Out). These work in conjunction with ageing date fields on the location and licence plate to track when inventory first entered the warehouse. These strategies can be used for both batch and non-batch tracked items, to ship items to customers based on when the inventory entered the warehouse. This can be especially useful for non-batch tracked inventory where an expiration date is not available to use for sorting. When inventory in first received/created in the warehouse, the licence plate is updated with the current date populated as the ageing date. This date is then used by the strategies to determine what is the oldest/youngest inventory in the warehouse. If inventory is moved to a non-licence plate tracked location, the location itself is updated with an ageing, which will also be used by the strategies.

WHSLPenhancementsFeatureDescription=This feature introduces several improvements and options for the licence plate receiving (and put away) processes. It adds an option that enables the warehousing mobile app to support licence plate receiving without needing to create warehouse work. Instead, it just registers the inbound physical inventory on the licence plate at the inbound receiving dock, allowing for items to be registered at locations that aren't licence-plate controlled. This feature also adds support for receiving at any location in a warehouse by letting you add location-specific licence plate receiving (and put away) menu items to the warehousing mobile app.

 ;Label for the WHSOrgWideAllocateWaveMethodParallelByDefaultFeature
WHSOrgWideAllocateWaveMethodParallelByDefaultFeature_Summary=This features gives you the option of running the allocateWave method for wave templates in parallel to improve wave processing performance. On enabling this feature, this parallel processing will be activated and task configurations will be created for all warehouses from all legal entities that have "Use warehouse management processes" enabled. Each task configuration includes a setting that lets you define the number of tasks that will run simultaneously (which is equivalent to the number of parallel processes). Roughly, the time used on the allocate-wave step (which is typically 30% to 60% of the total processing time) is reduced by a factor equivalent to the number of tasks. It’s also possible to define the batch group that will be assigned to process these tasks. When this feature is enabled, all legal entities will process waves in batches and "Wait for lock" will be set to a default value of 60,000 ms if it was previously set to 0 ms. Other than this, the existing task and wave processing configurations will be kept for all warehouses that are already configured to process waves in batches, and for all warehouses that are already configured to use the allocateWave method in parallel.\r\n\r\nAfter enabling this feature, all new legal entities will be configured by default to process waves in batches, "Wait for lock" will be set to a default value of 60,000 ms, and all new warehouses with "Use warehouse management processes" enabled will have the allocateWave method configured to run in parallel by default. Existing warehouses for which you change "Use warehouse management processes" from "no" to "yes" will also run this method in parallel by default.

This functionality solves scenarios where additional criteria is required to drive warehouse picking process, e.g. by the time of shipping, picking zone, Location profile, or even based on a combination of different criteria.\nThis functionality extends the current system directed picking with new System directed query order where the user can set up a sequence and a query or multiple queries which will evaluate all created work orders. It will therefore capture and present only the work orders that meet the specified criteria of the mobile device menu item setup.\nOrganization-wide system directed work sequencing enables the system directed work sequencing feature for all legal entities within the organisation.\nThe feature will validate that obsoleted methods due to the system directed work sequencing feature are not extended by ISVs.\nAfter the validation, the system directed work sequencing feature will be enabled across all legal entities, that are not yet enabled by the original 'System directed work sequencing feature in feature management.

WHSOutboundSortingFeature_Summary=With this functionality, several industries will experience easier handling of small containers and will enable the warehouse workers to better plan and organise pallet capacity within the truck.\nWith the outbound sorting you now can sort packed containers to a correct pallet after packing station and to build a packing hierarchy.\nThis functionality allows for the building of pallets from containers packed through the Packing functionality. The container is not sent to the final shipping location as it would be in the original Packing flow. Instead, this functionality allows the user to close the container and move it to a Sort type location. They can then sort containers onto positions, each position has a licence plate. Once the containers have been sorted, work can be created to send the whole LP to the final shipping dock or stage locations based on Location Directives/customer requirements. The closing of the sort position can also immediately move the inventory to the final shipping location and pick it to the order.

Previously, each field to be displayed was identified internally using a table ID and field name, but when you are using scale units, the table IDs typically change between the hub and scale unit databases. This feature updates the system to instead specify these fields using the table name and field name, which makes the configuration portable between databases because table names don't change. This feature makes no changes to the user interface.\nNote: On enabling this feature, the system will update relevant data across all legal entities.

WHSPlannedCrossDockingFeature_Label=Planned cross docking
 ;Label for WHSPlannedCrossDockingFeature
WHSPlannedCrossDockingFeature_Summary=This functionality introduces advanced planned cross docking where the inventory quantity required to satisfy an order will be directed to the correct outbound dock or staging area straight from receipt or creation. All remaining inventory from the inbound source will be directed to the correct storage location through regular put away process. This warehouse process is called cross docking.\nCross docking therefore allows the worker to skip inbound put away and outbound picking of inventory that is already marked to an outbound order. The result is minimised number of touches of inventory where possible, together with greater time and space savings on the warehouse shop floor due to less interaction with the system.

 ;Feature label
WHSPopulateSourceAndTargetLPOnWHSWorkTransFeature_Summary=This feature causes the system to be more consistent in the way it uses the columns of the WHSWorkTrans table, which stores information about user actions related to warehouse work. This change makes the system easier for developers to understand and may be required by future features related to inventory transactions. If your system includes customisations that affect or are affected by the WHSWorkTrans table, then you should enable this feature on a development system, test and modify your customisations as needed, and then deploy the updates to your production system. Then you can enable this feature on your production system to prepare it to take advantage of future updates. As a result of this feature, the system will store source and destination licence plate information more consistently in the various columns of the table (no columns are removed or added). The first time you turn on this feature, it will process the WHSWorkTrans table by moving target licence plate information for incomplete work to the TargetlicencePlateId column. It will also deduce the source licence plate information for the pick work lines and update the InventDimId column accordingly. Records for already completed work won't be affected. Thereafter, the system will continue to work using the new convention.

As inventory in the pick location drops below a configurable threshold, more replenishment work will be made available.

WHSShipConsolidationPolicyFeature_Summary=This feature allows for automated consolidation of shipment at the time of batch releasing sales or transfer orders. Shipment consolidation policies can be setup. The policies have queries to define their applicability and a modifiable set of fields driving the decision for grouping load lines on shipment level automatically at release to warehouse. When releasing to warehouse manually the same logic is triggered when added to open shipments. \r\n\r\nWarning!: If no policies are configured the system falls back to legacy behaviour. This means that in case you want to for example enable a new warehouse for customer account shipment consolidation, you must make sure to define new shipment consolidation policies for all existing warehouses which was using “Consolidate shipment at release to warehouse” in previous versions within your legal entity. \r\n\r\nNote!: In case you would like shipment consolidation on order line level, you can define a shipment consolidation policy with a query which returns no results.

It applies when you use loads and shipping carriers in transportation management. Without this feature, the system always updates the mode of delivery for all the lines, and the header, to match the new load, even if only some of the lines are assigned to the new load. This feature ensures that when you create a load for a sales order line, the system will respect the accounts receivable setting for updating lines based on sales order header changes. The settings are located on the "Update order lines" dialogue box for the "Accounts receivable parameters" page. To reproduce the previous behaviour, the following settings on this dialogue box must be set to "Always": Updating Transport, Updating Mode of delivery, and Updating Delivery terms.

This addition can be useful in the warehouses where Waves are being created based on a certain criterion, but automatic Wave creation is preferred to manual.\nThe system can leverage this Wave template setup to split released lines and appropriately create multiple Waves when required. If set up correctly, as the new Shipment is released, the system will attempt to add it to the first Wave if the grouping or break field(s) match, otherwise it will continue to evaluate other Waves until it must create a new one.

In case of zones, specific zones are then added to the Zone selection query and those will be evaluated by the newly created replenishment template when processed. \nJust like location-based min/max replenishment, the zone-based min/max replenishment is based on setting up a minimum threshold of inventory that triggers the creation of replenishment work order for selected items and item variants. In return, replenishment will be created for quantity that increases inventory up to the desired zone maximum threshold.
