ProdBOM_QuantityGroup=Enter the number of units of the item that are used to produce one piece of the finished item. If there is a gain of the item instead of a loss, enter a negative quantity. For example, on the production order (P), the dimensions for the finished item are selected in the Measurement field group as follows: Height (P) 1.00; Width (P) 0.50. In the production BOM (B), measurements are specified as follows: Formula = Height * Width * Constant; Height (B) 1.00; Width (B) 0; Constant (B) 2.00. If Width is not selected in the BOM, the Width dimension is not proportional to the width that is specified in the production table. Even if you use Height * Width * Constant as your formula, if you enter 0.00 in the BOM, the expression Width * Width is set to 1. The calculation of this example is as follows: Quantity = Height (P) * Width (P) * Height (B) * Width (B) * Constant (B) = 1.00 * 0.50 * 1.00 * (blank = 1.00) * 2.00 = 1.00.

For example, paint is stored in inventory in 25-quart cans. When it is taken from inventory, it is taken in 25-quart-can increments. In this case, rounding-up according to consumption is selected, and multiples are set to 25. The production quantity for the finished item is 20 units, and 2 quarts of paint must be used for each unit. Consumption is calculated as 20 units x 2 quarts = 40 quarts.

ProdRouteOprOverview_Overlap_TransferBatchHelp=Transfer batch quantity defines the minimum batch quantity transferred to the next operation. If left blank the next operation will not start until the entire order quantity is completed for the operation. Note that it doesn’t mean that the next operation always starts when the transfer batch quantity has been produced by the current operation. On a production order route the “Transfer batch” quantity provides input to the calculated “Overlap quantity”. The overlap quantity defines the minimum quantity that must be produced for the next operation on a specific production order to avoid gaps. Gaps would be caused by waiting time for additional component between the operations. Example: Operation 20 has a shorter process time than operation 10. In this case the overlap quantity can be increased, from the transfer batch quantity, to ensure that operation 20 doesn’t start until operation 10 has produced enough components to avoid gaps on operation 20. The fact that the successor operation would wait for the delivery from the predecessor would cause a gap. So, the calculation of an optimal overlap quantity is done based on the transfer batch and the route operations process durations.

ProdRoute_ProdRoute_TransferBatch=Specify the quantity that can be moved between sequential operations resources.
 ;Description text for the ProdRoute_TransferBatch control on the ProdRoute form
ProdRoute_ProdRoute_TransferBatchHelp=Transfer batch quantity defines the minimum batch quantity transferred to the next operation. If left blank the next operation will not start until the entire order quantity is completed for the operation. Note that it doesn’t mean that the next operation always starts when the transfer batch quantity has been produced by the current operation. On a production order route the “Transfer batch” quantity provides input to the calculated “Overlap quantity”. The overlap quantity defines the minimum quantity that must be produced for the next operation on a specific production order to avoid gaps. Gaps would be caused by waiting time for additional component between the operations. Example: Operation 20 has a shorter process time than operation 10. In this case the overlap quantity can be increased, from the transfer batch quantity, to ensure that operation 20 doesn’t start until operation 10 has produced enough components to avoid gaps on operation 20. The fact that the successor operation would wait for the delivery from the predecessor would cause a gap. So, the calculation of an optimal overlap quantity is done based on the transfer batch and the route operations process durations.

ProdSchedule_LimitationsDefaults_MatLimited=Select this option if you want materials to be considered limited during scheduling. If the materials are limited, the material's coverage for that time will be considered. In other words, scheduling considers the futures dates that are calculated for the items. Scheduling reserves raw materials and explodes the current production. If scheduling occurs several times, only the first scheduling will run an explosion and make reservations. If you make changes in the production BOM or route, the next scheduling will run an explosion. The explosion assumes that the materials are needed the same day. Because the production is not scheduled at the time of the master schedule explosion, the current date is the best estimate of when the items will be available. The explosion then checks whether the items are available. If the items are available, fulfilling the production requirement is possible. If the items are not available by the current date, a planned order will be generated and an offset selection made for the planned order. If automatic firming is set for the planned order, the planned order will be firmed automatically for purchase or production. The production status will automatically change to the status specified in the Requested production status field in the Coverage groups dialog box.

An operation cannot be included in the route more than one time.
 ;Description text for the ProdRoute_OprId control on the ProdTableOverview form
ProdTableOverview_ProdRoute_OprPriority=The priority of the operation. Priority is used to control simultaneous operations. Simultaneous operations are characterized by the fact that they appropriate several operations resources at the same time, for example, a machine and a tool. This is accomplished by giving the same Oper. No. value to all operations that are to be executed at the same time. The priority determines which operation is the primary one. The primary operation should be the operation loading the operations resource that is regarded as the bottleneck for simultaneous operations. A bottleneck operations resource is not defined in any special way in the system, because individual routes and productions determine which operations resources form the bottleneck. Therefore, an operations resource regarded as a bottleneck on one route, and therefore defined as primary for simultaneous operations on that route, can be secondary on another route. If the operation is not primary, the times from the primary operation are used to schedule the secondary operation. Thus times do not have to be specified for secondary operations. If there are no parallel operations for an operation number, the operation will be created that has a primary priority.

RouteInventProd_OverlapGroup_TransferBatch=Transfer batch quantity defines the minimum batch quantity transferred to the next operation. If left blank the next operation will not start until the entire order quantity is completed for the operation. Note that it doesn’t mean that the next operation always starts when the transfer batch quantity has been produced by the current operation. On a production order route the “Transfer batch” quantity provides input to the calculated “Overlap quantity”. The overlap quantity defines the minimum quantity that must be produced for the next operation on a specific production order to avoid gaps. Gaps would be caused by waiting time for additional component between the operations. Example: Operation 20 has a shorter process time than operation 10. In this case the overlap quantity can be increased, from the transfer batch quantity, to ensure that operation 20 doesn’t start until operation 10 has produced enough components to avoid gaps on operation 20. The fact that the successor operation would wait for the delivery from the predecessor would cause a gap. So, the calculation of an optimal overlap quantity is done based on the transfer batch and the route operations process durations.
 ;Description text for the ProdRoute_TransferBatch control on the RouteInventProd form
RouteInventProd_ProdRoute_OprId=The operation that uses the operation or the related resource in the production route. You can use this field to specify a unique identifier for the operation.

RouteInventProd_ProdRoute_OprPriority=Select the priority. The priority controls the order in which operations are performed when two or more operations require the same resources at the same time. You can allow for this by giving the same operation number to all operations that are run at the same time. The priority determines which of the simultaneous operations is primary. One of the simultaneous operations may load a resource that is the bottleneck for those operations. We recommend that you assign primary priority to this operation. Individual routes and productions determine which resources form the bottleneck. A resource that is a bottleneck on one route, and that is therefore a primary resource for simultaneous operations on that route, can be a secondary resource on another route. The times from the primary operation are used to schedule secondary operations. Therefore, you do not have to specify times for secondary operations. If there are no parallel operations for an operation, the operation is assigned primary priority.

A machine with 1,000 rotations per hour is used to perform an operation where two pieces of the finished item are finished per rotation. The production of finished items per hour will then be 2,000 pieces. You specify 1,000 for the resource's capacity per hour, and set the formula factor for the operation in the route to 0.5 (P). The calculation is made as follows: Process quantity per hour = 1,000 (K) / 0.5 (P) = 2,000 pieces.

Route_CostCategories_ProcessCategoryId=Specify the run time category that is used when the operation is run. The cost amount is calculated as follows: process time * scrap percentage * rate for operator time.
 ;Description text for the CostCategories_ProcessCategoryId control on the Route form
Route_CostCategories_QtyCategoryId=Specify the quantity category that will be used when the operation is run. The quantity category specifies the Cost price that is used to make a cost estimate for the production order. The cost is calculated with the following formula: Accumulated * Quantity * Cost price. The sales price for the quantity category is calculated through the cost group. Each cost group has one or more profit settings with a profit percentage. When making a cost estimate for production, specify which profit setting, and which profit percentage, you want to use when calculating the sales price. The cost group is managed in the Cost groups page. The Production route page is filled in automatically with the quantity category that is selected in the Operations page when an operation has been specified. The quantity category can be changed. When you create operations, the quantity category is filled in automatically with the quantity category that is specified for the selected resource group or resource.
 ;Description text for the CostCategories_QtyCategoryId control on the Route form
Route_CostCategories_SetUpCategoryId=Select a setup category for the operation on the route version. The cost amount is calculated based on the setup time defined in the operation multiplied by the rate for setup time retrieved from the setup type.
 ;Description text for the CostCategories_SetUpCategoryId control on the Route form
Route_ctrlRoute_OprNum=The operation number, which defines the sequence for the operations that the production is to run. When you create a new production route, the system automatically suggests 10 as the first operation number, and the following operation numbers are suggested in increments of 10. You can change both parts manually. If you create simultaneous operations, operations that appropriate several resources at the same time, the operations must be created by using the same operation number.
 ;Description text for the ctrlRoute_OprNum control on the Route form
Route_DocuRef_TypeId=Select the document type from the list view of options when you create a new record by pressing CTRL+N. You cannot change the document type after the record has been created.

Route_OverlapGroup_TransferBatch=The quantity that can be moved between sequential resources.
 ;Description text for the OverlapGroup_TransferBatch control on the Route form
Route_OverlapGroup_TransferBatchHelp=Transfer batch quantity defines the minimum batch quantity transferred to the next operation. If left blank the next operation will not start until the entire order quantity is completed for the operation. Note that it doesn’t mean that the next operation always starts when the transfer batch quantity has been produced by the current operation. On a production order route the “Transfer batch” quantity provides input to the calculated “Overlap quantity”. The overlap quantity defines the minimum quantity that must be produced for the next operation on a specific production order to avoid gaps. Gaps would be caused by waiting time for additional component between the operations. Example: Operation 20 has a shorter process time than operation 10. In this case the overlap quantity can be increased, from the transfer batch quantity, to ensure that operation 20 doesn’t start until operation 10 has produced enough components to avoid gaps on operation 20. The fact that the successor operation would wait for the delivery from the predecessor would cause a gap. So, the calculation of an optimal overlap quantity is done based on the transfer batch and the route operations process durations.
 ;Description text for the OverlapGroup_TransferBatch control on the Route form
Route_RequirementSet_LoadPercent=The percentage of maximum capacity that has been reserved. The maximum capacity is specified in the work calendar.
 ;Description text for the RequirementSet_LoadPercent control on the Route form
Route_RequirementSet_Quantity=The number of operations resources involved if a resource group is specified in the Requirement type field. When a resource is selected, this field must contain the value 1. For example, the operation requires two resources from a resource group that consists of five machines. The process time for the operation is three hours, and 2 is specified in the Quantity field. For operations scheduling, six hours are reserved for the operations resource group. For job scheduling, three hours are reserved for two different operations resources. In the Production route page for the production, the operations resource quantity is filled in automatically with the quantity specified here. However, it can be changed for the current operation in the production route.

 ;Description text for the RouteOpr_RouteCode control on the Route form
Route_RouteOpr_RouteGroupId=Assign the operation to a route group. The route group selection controls how an operation is calculated, how feedback is given, how an operation is scheduled, how an operation is job managed, and whether the Gregorian or working time calendar is used. Route groups are managed in the Route groups page. In the Production route page for a production, the route group is filled in automatically with the route group that is specified for the selected Operations page. The route group can be changed for the current operation in the production route. When you create operations in the Operations page, the route group is filled in automatically with the route group specified in Resource groups (operations resources)form or the Resources (operations resources) page.

Route_RouteOpr_RouteRel=This field displays the route or is blank, depending on the value selected in the Route code.
 ;Description text for the RouteOpr_RouteRel control on the Route form
Route_Route_AccError=The calculated accumulated scrap percentage for this operation in the route. The accumulated percentage is used in calculating the over consumption of materials and resource time for the operation. The calculation is as follows: Accumulated % = Accumulated % (for the following operation) * 100 / (100 - Scrap percentage). The error percentage is also summed in the production route in the Scrap percentage field. The description of the Scrap percentage field displays an example of the use of scrap percentage.
 ;Description text for the Route_AccError control on the Route form
Route_Route_ErrorPct=Define the expected over-consumption for the operation. Scrap percentage must be positive. The over-consumption is included both in the calculation of material consumption and in the resource consumption for the current operation. You can also use the error percentage to calculate the quantity to be started for each production, because an error percentage means that more materials and resources must be issued in order to produce the scheduled quantity. The Scrap percentage field is automatically populated in with the error percentage for the operation that you select in the route. You can correct the scrap percentage in the production route. If several operations in the route have error percentages, you can see the summed error percentage for this and previous operations in the Accumulated field.

Route_Route_JobPayType=The pay type on jobs that delimit this item.
 ;Description text for the Route_JobPayType control on the Route form
Route_Route_OprNumNext=The operation number that follows the current operation. If you selected Route network in the Production control parameters page, enter the next operation number manually. Otherwise, the next operation number is entered automatically, and you cannot enter any value in Next. A value of 0 (zero) indicates that an operation in the route network is the last on the route. There can be only one last operation.
 ;Description text for the Route_OprNumNext control on the Route form
Route_Route_OprPriority=The priority, which controls simultaneous operations. Simultaneous operations appropriate several resources at the same time, such as a machine and a tool. To use this function, give all operations for simultaneous execution the same operation number. You can specify which operation is the primary one. The primary operation is the operation loading the resource that is the bottleneck for the simultaneous operations. A resource regarded as the bottleneck on one route, and therefore defined as the primary resource for simultaneous operations on this route, can be a secondary resource on another route. The times that you specify for the primary operation are used automatically with the secondary operations. If there are no simultaneous operations on a route, all operations are created as primary.
 ;Description text for the Route_OprPriority control on the Route form
Route_Route_PropertyId=Properties indicate an operation's characteristics. If the production is job scheduled with limited capacity and limited properties, resource capacity will only be reserved for a period during which the resource has this property.
 ;Description text for the Route_PropertyId control on the Route form
Route_Route_RouteGroupId=Assign the operation to a route group. The route group selection controls how an operation is calculated, how feedback is given, how an operation is scheduled, how an operation is job managed, and whether the Gregorian or working time calendar is used. Route groups are managed in the Route groups page. In the Production route page for a production, the route group is filled in automatically with the route group that is specified for the selected Operations page. The route group can be changed for the current operation in the production route. When you create operations in the Operations page, the route group is filled in automatically with the route group specified in Resource groups (operations resources)form or the Resources (operations resources) page.
 ;Description text for the Route_RouteGroupId control on the Route form
Route_TimesGroup_ProcessPerQty=The quantity that can be produced in the specified run time.
 ;Description text for the TimesGroup_ProcessPerQty control on the Route form
Route_TimesGroup_ProcessTime=The time that is required to produce the process quantity. If a factor is not specified for the operation relation or the resource, the Run time field is expressed in hours with two decimals. If a value is specified in the Hours/time field for the operation relation, that value overrides the Hours/time value for the resource. The Process qty. value must be a positive value. For a description of conversion to other time intervals, see the description of the Hours/time field. The operation's Route groups page determines how time is scheduled. The system calculates time as follows: run time * load * (1 + accumulated) * Quantity / Process qty. If you selected Capacity in the Formula field for the production route, run time is always set to one and the process quantity is calculated based on the factor with the number of capacity units that you specified for the current resource.
 ;Description text for the TimesGroup_ProcessTime control on the Route form
Route_TimesGroup_QueueTimeAfter=The queue time the items must wait after the operation is finished but before the next operation can start. The value in the Queue time field must be positive. The field is scheduled according to the setup for the route group in the Working time field, and can use either the Gregorian calendar or the current working time calendar. You can use the field, for example, to refer to the drying of items before the next operation can start.
 ;Description text for the TimesGroup_QueueTimeAfter control on the Route form
Route_TimesGroup_QueueTimeBefore=The queue time before the operation can start. The queue time must be positive. You set up the field in the route group, where you can determine whether the queue time should be scheduled and which calendar should be used. You can use the queue time, for example, with sub-supplier work.
 ;Description text for the TimesGroup_QueueTimeBefore control on the Route form
Route_TimesGroup_SetupTime=The setup time, which must be a positive value, is the fixed time it takes to prepare a resource. The time is scheduled according to the calendar for the resource and is independent of the production quantity. In scheduling, a capacity load is also registered for the time on the resource. The setup time is filled in automatically with the setup time specified for the operation route when you select the operation route. However, the setup time can be changed in the current production route.
 ;Description text for the TimesGroup_SetupTime control on the Route form
Route_TimesGroup_ToHours=The conversion factor for those times specified for the operation for conversion to hours with two decimals. Conversion uses the following formula: Hours equal operating hours * Hours/time. The following is an example of conversion of hours to hours with two decimals. The operation time is 0.50 (a half hour), and the hours/time is 10,000. The time is calculated as 0.50 * 10,000 = 0.50 hours. If the operation time is in minutes, Hours/time is set to 0.0167. For an operation time of 30 minutes, for example, that time becomes 0.50 hours when you apply the conversion factor. Time calculation: 30.00 * 0.0167 = 0.50 hours.
 ;Description text for the TimesGroup_ToHours control on the Route form
Route_TimesGroup_TranspTime=Transport time for transporting items between two resources or from the last operation to inventory. How transit time is used depends on how the operation's route group is set up. The transport time must be a positive value.
 ;Description text for the TimesGroup_TranspTime control on the Route form
WhsProduction_AllowMaterialOverPick=Configure the raw material picking principle for a licence plate location. Select Order picking to specify that only the ordered quantity should be picked. Select Staging to specify that the full quantity should be picked from the licence plate.

 ;Description for the WhsProduction_ProdQty control on the EcoResProducDetailsExtended form
WhsProduction_WhsProduction_PickWCNeg=Select this option to allow for a negative quantity of a product when the product is picked to production. Allowing for a physical negative inventory can help avoid blocking issues when products are back flushed in production. This is, for example, relevant for low-value materials that are tracked only periodically. This option must be selected in combination with allowing for physical negative inventory on the Inventory model group on the warehouse where the material is consumed and on the location directive for raw material picking.
 ;Description for the WhsProduction_PickWCNeg control on the EcoResProducDetailsExtended form
WrkCtrResourceRequirementPart_WrkCtrActivityRequirement_UsedForJobScheduling=Specify whether the resource requirement should be taken into account when scheduling is run at the job level. This lets you use more specific resource requirements for the detailed capacity plan.
