CustParameters_RMA_SalesReturnDeliverRemainderPolicy=The policy ‘Deliver remainder policy when RMA line cannot be split’ controls the behaviour for RMA line registration when the decimal precision for the sales or catch weight unit of measurement does not allow the RMA line to be split.

Select the parameter value ‘Delete remainder when RMA line cannot be split’ to allow for partial quantity registration in scenarios where it is not possible to split the RMA line due to decimal precision setup. When ‘Delete remainder when RMA line cannot be split’ is selected and a partial registration is done then no subsequent registrations will be possible in scenarios where the RMA line cannot be split due to decimal precision. The otherwise remaining quantity will be automatically deleted. Select the parameter value ‘Enforce validate full quantity registration when RMA line cannot be split’ to enforce that the full RMA line quantity must be registered in scenarios where it is not possible to split the RMA line due to decimal precision setup. The entire quantity must be registered.
