PrintReportHelpText=The parameter controls the printing of the VAT payment report after the Settle and post VAT procedure is finished. When the parameter is set to No, after the settlement process is completed, no VAT payment report is printed. Instead, you receive the following message: "The VAT settlement and posting is completed. The voucher 'xxxx, m/d/yyyy' has been posted."\r\nThe report might not print automatically, even if the parameter is set to Yes. You can print the report from the 'VAT payments' page after 'Settle and post VAT' is executed, or if 'Settle and post VAT' is run in a batch, you can print the report from the 'VAT payments' page once the job is completed.
