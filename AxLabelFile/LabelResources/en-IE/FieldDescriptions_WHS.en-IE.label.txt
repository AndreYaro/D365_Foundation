WHSAdjustmentType_WHSAdjustmentType_RemoveReservation=This option controls what happens to existing reservations when a worker makes negative stock adjustments using a mobile device. This can have an effect, for example, when adjusting out or short picking in situations where the total quantity remaining in the warehouse after the quantity adjustment at a specific location would be insufficient to fulfil existing reserved demand.\r\n \r\nThis option applies only to reservations made above the location level, such as for sales order lines. This option doesn't affect reservations created for work, which are done at the location level.\r\n \r\nIf this option is enabled, order line reservations will be removed or reduced as needed to allow workers to register quantity reductions using their mobile devices. No changes occur if the warehouse still includes enough stock to fulfil all existing order line reservations after making a quantity reduction.\r\n \r\nIf this option is disabled, and the warehouse would no longer have enough stock to fulfil all existing reservations after a worker makes a quantity adjustment, then the worker's mobile device will show an error message for the action requesting the stock adjustment.

WHSAutoReleaseToWarehouse_GroupIntoMultipleReleases=This option controls whether the system should process release to warehouse operations separately for each customer or whether it should release all sales orders at once. When this option is enabled, the system will collect all the sales order lines for a selected customer, release those orders to the warehouse, and then process the next customer. When this option is disabled, the system will release all available sales order lines in a single release to warehouse operation. Enabling this option improves performance and resilience of the release to warehouse process. However, you must be cautious when using this option together with wave templates that are configured to "Process wave at release to warehouse" because this combination may generate many single-customer waves, each with work generated for that customer only. If you want to generate work that combines shipments for multiple customers, you should either turn off the "Group releases by customer" option or configure your wave templates to use postponed processing.

WHSCatchWeightItemHandlingMethod_OutboundWeightVarianceMethod=This policy represents options for varying weight on outbound transactions and controls whether captured weight can result in catch weight profit/loss adjustments.\r\n- Allow weight variance: Weight must be captured on the mobile device when executing the outbound transaction. If the captured weight is different from the current stock weight, catch weight profit/loss transaction will be recorded.\r\n- Restrict weight variance: When all stock from the physical dimension set is being consumed, current stock weight will be displayed on the mobile device and the user will not be allowed to vary the weight. Actual stock weight will be consumed. When not all stock from the physical dimension set is being consumed, the user will need to enter the weight but will receive an error if the captured weight would result in the remaining weight to fall out of the acceptable tolerance range for the item. This policy option is also used when registering material consumption for batch orders.

WHSCatchWeightItemHandlingPolicy_MovementWeightCapturingMethod=During the stock movement or movement by template process, the weight will be captured in one of three methods. Not captured: Weight is not entered during the move process. Instead the average weight per CW Unit is calculated and that is the weight that is moved. Example, moving 3 boxes when 4 boxes are in stock with a total weight of 44, means that moving 3 boxes will move weight of 33, using the calculated average weight of 11. Per catch weight unit: Weight is captured per CW unit. Example, moving 3 boxes of an item would require you to capture weight 3 times (once per box). Per picking quantity: Quantity to move is the quantity currently being processed. Example, moving 3 boxes of an item would require you to capture the weight once for the 3 boxes.

If you don't often run many location directives in parallel, then you can choose to "Optimise performance", though you may occasionally experience concurrency errors. If you tend to process many location directives in parallel, then choose "Enforce strict concurrency checks" to implement locking, which will prevent concurrency errors but will also slow performance.
 ;Description for the WHSParameters_PutLocationDirectiveConcStrictness control on WHSParameters form.
WHSParameters_PutLocationDirectiveLockTime=Enter the maximum time the system should wait to acquire a location lock when processing location directives for put work./r/nThis setting is relevant when several threads are trying to execute put-work location directives simultaneously. When a thread is trying to find a put location, it performs several checks to make sure the location is suitable for the put-work line. Some checks (such as mixing constraints) must be processed one thread at a time to prevent multiple threads from trying to use the same location. If additional threads try to check the same location, those threads will be blocked and queued. This setting represents the maximum acceptable time that a thread will wait for the lock to be released after being acquired by a previous thread for the same location. A maximum of 30 seconds (30,000 milliseconds) is typically a good choice. If the wait time is too short, you risk producing work with a large number of different put locations. A relatively long wait time won't usually waste resources because as soon as a lock is released, the next process will resume immediately. However, you still shouldn't let it wait for too long because a long delay may indicate some other problem, which means allowing the thread to fail may reset something or allow you to address the issue, thereby preventing the excessive processing times that could result from allowing threads to be stuck for a long time.\r\n

WHSParameters_WHSParameters_WaveLockWait=Enter the maximum wait time for acquiring an item (plus dimension) lock during wave processing.\r\nThis setting is relevant when several waves are released in a row but, due to congestion in accessing the tables, some waves end up running simultaneously. When a wave is processing, during the allocation step it tries to acquire a lock on the combination of item plus the dimensions above location. When one or more concurrent waves also try to acquire the same lock for an identical record, those waves will be blocked and queued. The value represents the maximum acceptable time that a wave will wait for a lock to be released when the lock was acquired by a previous wave for the same item plus dimension above location; it establishes a staging period between waves. A maximum of 60 seconds (60,000 milliseconds) is typically a good choice. If the wait time is too short, you risk producing a high volume of wave failures due to timeouts. A relatively long wait time won't usually waste resources because as soon as a lock is released, the next process will resume immediately. However, you still shouldn't let it wait for too long because a long delay may indicate some other problem, which means allowing the wave to fail may reset something or allow you to address the issue, thereby preventing the excessive processing times that could result from allowing waves to be stuck for a long time.

WHSReleaseToWarehouseService_GroupIntoMultipleReleases=This option controls whether the system should process release to warehouse operations separately for each destination warehouse or whether it should release all transfer orders at once. When this option is enabled, the system will collect all the transfer order lines for a selected destination warehouse, release those orders, and then process the next destination warehouse. When this option is disabled, the system will release all available transfer order lines in a single release to warehouse operation. Enabling this option improves performance and resilience of the release to warehouse process. However, you must be cautious when using this option together with wave templates that are configured to "Process wave at release to warehouse" because this combination may generate many single-warehouse waves, each with work generated for that destination warehouse only. If you want to generate work that combines shipments for multiple warehouses, you should either turn off the "Group releases by destination warehouse" option or configure your wave templates to use postponed processing.

WHSRFMenuItem_WHSRFMenuItemTable_AllowFullSplit=This option controls whether workers can use more than one licence plate to transport items for a single line of picking work.
