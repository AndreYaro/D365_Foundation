PageNumberingImprovementsFeatureLabel=(Italy) Financial journal page numbering improvements
 ;Feature label
PageNumberingImprovementsFeatureSummary=This feature improves the calculation logic for page numbering in the Italian financial journal report. To update and store the page numbers, either print the report to screen with the feature "Report PDF Viewer" enabled, or print the report to file in PDF format. Page numbers are calculated using the new algorithm when the financial journal report is printed in PDF format. Page numbers are stored so that pages for the next month’s report start sequentially using the next number after the stored one. This feature also enables an algorithm for grouping lines with all the same values in columns into one line, so that there are no unnecessary pages in the report printout.
